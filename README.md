# Discord-Roblox-Bot
# DO NOT USE THIS 
## IT IS NOT SAFE BECAUSE THERE IS NO ENCRYPTION AND EVEN IF THERE WAS IT WOULD BYPASS IT WHEN IT SHOUTS THE PASSWORD INTO YOUR DISCORD SERVER

This is an example of how you could use Discord, Python, and SQL to store usernames and passwords, and display them. (Please do not use this, it is not secure and was just done as a demo of knowledge.)


Otherwise, if you'd like to use it... You'll need to make a .env file with the following keys:

PROD=(Bool- set this to true unless you also want to append DEV to the end of the other keys)
sqlHost
sqlUser
sqlPass
sqlDB
channel
discordEMbotRobloxToken
